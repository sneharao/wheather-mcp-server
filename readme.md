## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

‚Äã
Why MCP?
MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

This project creates one such MCP server , which you can interact with claude desktop client.
